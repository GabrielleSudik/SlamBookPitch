<p>The Slam Book provides several possible creative solutions and logical possibilities.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Friends can create private groups, or keep questions public.</li>
    <li>Users can rely on Pen Names or Real Names.</li>
    <li>Answers could be kept hidden until a user answers a certain number (to "seed the pot").</li>
    <li>A pre-made list of default questions can be written; users can select all, some or none for their groups.</li>
    <li>Readers can vote for Best Ofs, like funniest answer, saddest story, most thought-provoking question, etc.</li>

</ul>
